# Buggy's Tech Blog
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
  ## Description
  This app is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequalize as the ORM, and the express-sessions npm package for authentication.

  My motivation to build this app was to gain/test my knowledge involving everything required to build a full stack app.
 
  I built this project to the MVC (model, view, controller) paradigm and the required back-end tech to provide authentication for users.
 
  This build allowed me to learn much more and actually implement my teachings. I was able to stumble through the code and learn valuable lessons from it.

  Some of my learnings included user authintication, how each part of the MVC paradigm truly relate to one another, and how challenging it can be to trace through each potential area to find the bug.

  ## Installation
  There is no instalation process for this app as it is loaded to a live server.
  
  ## Usage
  This app will be used as a small time blog post for others. For myself, this app was used as a teaching lesson and will continue to act as studying material as I will look over it and possibly tweak it.
